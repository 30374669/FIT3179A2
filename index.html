      <h1>Global Renewable Energy Usage</h1>
      <h3>
        Data obtained from Kaggle reports on the renewable energy usage from 2000 to 2019. The data provided detailed overview on
       the usage of energy in each country, including types of energy used/generated, percentage of renewable energy from overall energy used
       and more.

     <div id="choropleth_map" ></div>
     <p class="body">
      In 2019, the countries in Africa has the most percentage of renewable energy shares from its total energy consumption
      this is largely due to the use of inexpensive energy generating sources such as solar and wind energy. From the article published on 
      the United Nations, “We recently saw Solar PV tariffs below $.04 making it the cheapest form of electricity generation and the logical choice for additional capacity,” Mr. Schroth told Africa Renewal.
      It is shown that the push by the UN to a renewable energy source have been successful in the region. There have also been improvement in diverging 
      the use of energy sources to renewable energy sources for a greener earth.

        <h4>Top 10 Countries with the most CO2 Emissions in 2019</h4>

      <div id="bubbleplot"></div>
      <p class="body">
        CO2 emmission studies can be depicted from many perspectives. A post by NASA stated that increase in CO2 emissions can be 
        caused by burning of fossil fuels, clearing of land for agriculture, industries and many more. We can see more developed countries with larger populations
         like China, India and United States have seen the largest contributor to the overall CO2 emission in 2019, these countries are the top 5 largest economies 
         in the world. Furthermore we can also depict that these countries are more reliant of fossil energy sources and energy that contributes to the increase in CO2 levels.

        Here we can see the total amount of electricity in TerraWatt Hour, where 1 terrawatt hour is enough to power 70,000 homes for a year. For Example the total power generated by China alone is 
        7,600 terawatthours (TWh) in 2020, according to Country Analysis Brief: China. We can see a upgrowing trend in countries adopting renewable energy sources, where technology improvement allowed 
        the adoption and growth of such environmental friendly energy source.
